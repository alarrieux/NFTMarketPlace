# NFT MarketPlace

This project is based on the tutorial provided by [Edge and Node]([url](https://dev.to/edge-and-node/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb)).  

Building an NFT marketplace with Polygon, Next.js, Tailwind, Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, and IPFS

To be successful in this guide, you must have the following:
Node.js version 16.14.0 or greater installed on your machine. I recommend installing Node using either nvm or fnm.
Metamask wallet extension installed as a browser extension


The stack
In this guide, we will build out a full stack application using:
Web application framework - Next.js
Solidity development environment - Hardhat
File Storage - IPFS
Ethereum Web Client Library - Ethers.js
